The station was originally named 'Acton Green' and was renamed to 'Chiswick Park' on 1 March 1910.  The original station was demolished in 1931 to accommodate the new Piccadilly line tracks, although the Piccadilly line has never served this station, and the new building opened in 1933.  The new station was designed by Charles Holden in a modern European style using brick, reinforced concrete and glass.  Similar to the station at Arnos Grove that Holden designed for the eastern Piccadilly line extension, the station's predominant feature is the tall semi-circular ticket hall.  Externally the brick walls of the ticket hall are punctuated with panels of clerestory windows and the structure is capped with a flat concrete slab roof.  To make the station's location visible from Chiswick High Road the station was also provided with a square brick tower surmounted by the roundel and the stations name.  The ticket hall once housed a central passimeter, whcih has now been replaced with the brick built ticket office accommodation which has altered the appearance of the grandiose hall.

He joined the merchant\r\nnavy for some years and in 1790, decided to rejoin the Royal Navy. His\r\nfirst appointment as midshipman was with HMS Hebe. He was later transferred\r\nto the sloop, HMS Tisphone, and followed the Captain, Anthony Hunt, when he \r\nwas transferred to HMS Amphitrite in 1793.\r\nIn November of that year, he was promoted to Lieutenant and appointed to HMS\r\nMeleager. This ship was part of a squadron off the coast of Genoa under the \r\ncommand of Captain Horatio Nelson. In August 1796, Hardy transferred to HMS\r\nMinerve with Captain Cockburn. At the end of the year, Nelson transferred to\r\nthe Sabina, Hardy, along with Lieutenant Culverhouse, was in charge of a boarding\r\nparty sent to claim her as a prize after her capture. They managed to draw off\r\nthe rest of the Spanish squadron, but the ship was later re-captured after\r\none of her masts was destroyed and Hardy was taken prisoner along with the rest\r\nof the boarding party.\r\n\r\nHe was later repatriated with the Minerve at Gibraltar after an exchange of \r\nprisoners, which included the Captain of the Sabina. Captain Nelson was warm\r\nin praise of the actions of his lieutenants in this action.\r\nShortly after rejoining his ship, Hardy was nearly captured again by the \r\nSpanish when he jumped overboard to save a seaman who was drowning after \r\nfalling out of one of the boats. The current had carried them towards the lead\r\nship of the Spanish squadron in the Gibraltar Straits. Nelson took instant action\r\nby ordering shorten their sail and stand off. Hardy and the seaman were\r\nrescued. A few days later, the ship had joined the British fleet and took part\r\nin the battle of Cape St Vincent on 14 February 1797.\r\nIn the following Maym HMSs Minerve and Lively were patrolling around the bay of\r\nSanta Cruz and found a French brig, the Mutine. On the 29th, longboats\r\nfrom the two ships were sent to capture it under Hardy's command. It\r\nwas successful and Hardy was appointed to command of the prize by Admiral\r\nJervis. He also was promoted to Commander.\r\n\r\nHardy went to the Mediterranean with Nelson, who had been appointed Commander\r\nin Chief. In July 1803, Nelson transferred to HMS Victory and Hardy joined him to \r\nresume his position as Flag Captain.During the following months and years, the\r\nship was kept busy with the blockade of Toulon and continuing pursuit of the \r\nFranco-Spanish fleet across the Atlantic. Hardy, along with Captain Blackwood,\r\nwitnessed Nelson's last will and during the battle of Trafalgar on \r\nOctober 21st 1805, was walking along side his Commander in chief when a \r\nFrench spiner fatally shot Nelson. As Nelson's Chief of Staff, he remained\r\non duty during the remainder of the battle while keeping his dying friend\r\nand Commabder informed of the proceedings. In recognition for these\r\nservices, he was created a baronet. He played a major part in the state\r\nfuneral of Nelson on 9 January 1806 at St Paul's Cathedral.\r\n\r\nHardy was decorated as a Knight Commander of the Order of Bath in\r\nJanuary 1815 and returned to Britain in June of that year. On his return,\r\nhe was appointed to command the Royal Yacht Princess Augusta. He served\r\non her for three years. In August 1819, he was promoted to Commodore and\r\nappointed as Commander in Chief for the South American station. He\r\ntransferred his flag to HMS Superb and his services during the war of\r\nindependence that was being fought in the former Spanish colonies won\r\nhim praise from the Admiralty. He eventually returned to Britain in 1824.\r\n\r\nIn 1830, he was appointed as First Sea Lord at the Admiralty. He\r\nretained this post until 1834. During this period, he was appointed\r\nas Knight Grand Cross of the Order of Bath. At the end of his period\r\nas First Sea Lord, he was appointed as Governor of Greenwich Hospital.\r\nDuring his time as Governor, he introduced many changes to improve the lives\r\nof the pensioners. He was promoted as Vice Admiral in January 1837.\r\nHardy died on 20th September 1839 and was buried in the mausoleum in the \r\ngrounds of Greenwich Hospital.

The canons established the famous hospital of St. Thomas that was moved to Lambeth in the 19th century. After the dissolution of the monastery in 1539 the Priory Church became the Parish Church of St. Saviour, in the Diocese of Winchester. In 1905 it was made a Cathedral with its own diocese, to serve the spiritual and material needs of south London's growing population. \r\n\r\nIn monastic times the parish church was in the Chapel of St. Mary Magdalene formerly on the south side of the chancel (to your left) but demolished in 1822 during restoration work on the choir.

RAF Uxbridge occupies the former estate and grounds of the historic Hillingdon House and has an important connection with Britain's air defence during the World War II.  The original Hillingdon House is thought to have been built in 1617 and was rebuilt in 1717 by the last Duke of Schonberg.  Prior to 1717, the estate had been identified as belonging partly to the manor of Swakeleys and partly to the Manor of Colham.  A Medieval settlement within this area was concentrated within te settlements of Hillingdon, Colham and Uxbridge and it is likely that the site lay within common land and wasteland between these.  The current Hillingdon House was rebuilt in 1844 after being destroyed by fire.  In 1907 the gardens covered 47 acres and contained a five-acre lake formed by a dam in the River Pinn.  The park as a while covered approximatley 158 acres with no significant changes by 1914.  The estate was bought by the Government in 1918 an used as a convalescence home for Canadian soldiers after which it became the RFC Armanent and Gunnery School.  In 1919 the RAF Depot relocated from Halton to the site and became the main recruit-training centre.  During the 1920's new barrack blocks around a large parade ground and other buildings were built to accommodate this.  Hillongdon House soon began to house headquarters for units, of which the most notable was No 11 (Fighter) Group who were there from 1936."}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[0.00741,51.56007],"is_accurate":true},"properties":{"id":4250,"inscription":"Alfred Joseph Hitchcock The famous film director was born near this site at 517 High Road Leytonstone on August 13th 1899.

The station was to be a focal point for a new suburb and although some development took place, areas to the north and east of the station became part of the protected London Green Belt.  The station building is a low European style brick structure flanked by two small towers each with a pole mounted roundel.  The alignment of road and rail approaches was developed to produce a ticket hall concourse of pentagonal plan.  Reinforced concrete was used for the entire concourse and train shed.  At the time, the use of such materials, unadorned, was viewed as a modernistic approach to buildings in this country.

The station was heavily redeveloped during that period, resulting in the demolition of the original c1870 highly ornate facade. The sign is typical of those designed for use on the Underground during the late 1920s and early 1930s when much thought was given to the standardisation of  sign design and typefaces used.  The sign displays the ones heavy timber frames used – In the early 1930s Charles Holden developed a slimmer bronze frame for signs used on new and reconstructed stations. It appears that many older stations that received new signs at this time continued to have the timber framed versions.\r\n\r\nThe pale yellow background was also commonly used – along with the use of the purposely designed Johnston black lettering that works so well in this situation being both legible and authoritative. The style of the arrow, the flight of which appears to pierce the ring of the roundel, is also indicative of the sign’s age. This device, commonly known as ‘Mexican arrow’, was used on signs from the mid-1920s until the 1960s as a unique graphic tool and also added familiarity to the brand London Transport. The use of four flights to the arrow dates it to the years either side of 1930.

Photographic evidence shows it in place by the late 1930s and it appears to have been removed during the 1970s.  The date of manufacture can certainly be better understood given the overall design and various styles of lettering and logos it shows.\r\n\r\nDuring the 1930s, when the new London Transport (formed in 1933) experimented with various designs of signs, most used his pale yellow background with the maroon border.  The arrow at the base of the sign was known as a ‘Mexican arrow’ and this example, with three flights on the arrow, dates it to post 1933, as prior to that date it would have had four flights. The sign also uses colour blocks as background to the text and this was increasingly used as a device by the Underground during this period. The design of some signs was further standardised when, in 1938, LT issued the first ‘Standard Signs Manual’.\r\n\r\nRichmond was owned and primarily served by the Southern Railway who, during this period developed their own ‘house style’ that included this “sunshine” style of lined out lettering. The underground logo, using the company’s Johnston typeface, has the distinctive white bands (or “ribbons”) above and below the letters. Then, as now, Richmond was served by the district line. The “LMS” lettering refers to the London Midland \u0026 Scottish Railway, another of the ‘big four’ railway companies that had been formed in 1923, and ran the North London Railway services between Richmond and Broad Street. This service is now provided by London Overground\r\n\r\nThe sign is a fascinating reminder of an earlier period of ‘co-ordination’ of elements of London's transport service that finally came to fruition with the formation of TfL. LU acquired the sign in 2008 from a private collector, who had salvaged the sign when it was removed, and is displayed here as part of LU’s heritage."}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-0.13902,51.51657],"is_accurate":true},"properties":{"id":9141,"inscription":"Site of the last home of James Barry 1741–1806 Irish artist and creator of the murals at The Royal Society of Arts"}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-0.18533,51.56084],"is_accurate":false},"properties":{"id":9238,"inscription":"John Lewis silk mercer of Oxford Street resided at Spedan Tower, Hampstead from 1888 to 1928 as did his elder son John Spedan Lewis later founder of the John Lewis partnership this plaque is placed near the site of Spedan Tower"}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-0.14251,51.48943],"is_accurate":true},"properties":{"id":456,"inscription":"Aubrey Beardsley 1872-1898 artist lived here"}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-0.11733,51.52468],"is_accurate":true},"properties":{"id":42360,"inscription":"Charlotte Mew 1869-1928 Poet lived here 1869-1890"}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-0.10222,51.52129],"is_accurate":false},"properties":{"id":8244,"inscription":"James Upjohn clock maker 1765-1794"}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-0.1378,51.5122],"is_accurate":true},"properties":{"id":1102,"inscription":"John Stephen 1934-2004 founder of Carnaby Street as world centre for men's fashion in the 1960's"}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-0.20436,51.51476],"is_accurate":true},"properties":{"id":1760,"inscription":"On this site Susan Garth launched London's first antiques market making The Portobello Road an international institution"}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-0.16267,51.4871],"is_accurate":true},"properties":{"id":256,"inscription":"Samuel L.
